            Learning languages
            as a lifestyle

          <p className='idiomap'>
            I decided to learn languages as a lifestyle for many reasons.
            The first is that I love communication and I want to be able to
            communicate with as many people as possible. The second is that I love
            learning new things and languages are a never-ending source of new things
            to learn. The third is that I believe that learning languages is a great way
            to connect with people and cultures around the world.

            Tech life

          <p className='techp'>
          Tech life, as I know it, consists of a lot of trial and error. 
          A passion for tech, however, can make it all worth while. 
          I'm currently a student at a coding bootcamp, and I've had to learn a lot of 
          new things in a very short amount of time. It's been tough, but my passion for 
          all things tech has made it worth while.
